Leaving Rostrevor, the first 10 miles sees riders ascending 700m through the Mourne Coming out of the Mournes and into the shadow of Slieve Donard, riders will get their first view of the Irish Sea as they then make their way up towards Belfast. En route, there is another swift ascent up Slieve Croob before entering the Belfast Hills and onto the magnificent Causeway Coast, finishing in the scenic town of Cushendall. It is a long day in the saddle with the most climbing out of all of the stages, but with fresh legs and an end of day massage, this shouldn’t be too much of a problem...",

Phenomenal views await riders as they approach the magnificent Torr Head and pass iconic landmarks including The Giants Causeway, Duncluce Castle, Royal Portrush and of course, Bushmills Distillery. Once at Magillian, riders can enjoy a ferry pit stop as they cross Lough Foyle and ride on from Greencastle towards the most northerly point of Ireland and Malin Head. Fully exposed to the weather off the North Atlantic, this can seem like one of the most rugged and hostile areas on earth and will put test to riders’ physical and mental stamina. Rounding Malin, riders will then head south towards the conclusion of the day’s stage in Bunrana but not before taking on the infamous Mamore Gap which has broken many an ego with a recorded gradient of 27% on its hairpins.",

The terrain is wild and untouched and riders will at times feel as if they are on a lunar landscape, such is the barren nature of the peat bogs.
